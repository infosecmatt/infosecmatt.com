            <p>Howdy! As you’ve probably inferred at this point, my name is Matt Johnson and I’m a student at Texas A&M University. The reasons for making this website are twofold. First, I wanted to have a place online where I could store and share my work and ideas. I don’t fancy myself a programmer, but I occasionally like to work on projects that simplify my life, help with productivity, or otherwise interest me at the time. Likewise, I don’t consider myself an incredible writer, but I do have many interests that lend themselves to writing — tech, travel, language learning, and other fun things — so you’re likely to see the occasional blog post to a (mostly imaginary) audience. Second, I wanted to learn the basics of web design, and I hope that each iteration of this site becomes smoother, better looking, and more user-friendly. Right now it’s pretty primitive, but after about a week and a half, I was able to make it usable and good looking enough to share with the world.</p>
            <h3>Why I chose to build it from scratch, and whether you should</h3>
            <p>As I hinted at previously, I built this site from scratch. When I had the initial idea of creating a personal website, I set up hosting on an Amazon server, started running Wordpress, and got… a bloated mess of a website that cost me money to run. I decided that for a personal site, it was better to just have a couple of static pages. Now, this isn’t to say that trying Wordpress was a bad idea, as I got very comfortable using the command line to operate a remote server (a skill that could come in handy). I just found it unnecessary.</p>
            <p>When I gave up on WP, I decided that it’d be a fun idea to learn the basics of HTML/CSS/JS, and the best way to do so was to make a website! This proved to be a fun and insightful project. I really enjoy the simplicity of the languages and have found that HTML/CSS alone can create a good looking and responsive website. I intentionally kept it pretty light on the JS, in part to keep it from being resource-intensive, but also because I haven’t yet found a huge need to use it. Over time this may change.</p>
            <p>Creating a website from scratch can be daunting. You have an infinite amount of options, and all of them seem like a challenge to implement. However, this is a great way to learn the fundamentals of web design, and even if the end product isn’t perfect (mine certainly isn’t!), you’ll come out on the other side knowing a lot more than you previously did. I may not ever become a web designer or even have a use for HTML/CSS beyond this site, but now I have enough experience that I could have a reasonably intelligible conversation with a web designer. I also have a website that costs me nothing and that I can proudly claim as being (<a href="../credits.html">almost</a>) completely my own.</p>
            <p>So should you build a website from scratch? If you're even remotely tech-savvy, you'll find that it's not difficult and adds to your arsenal of knowledge. If you have the time and the will to learn, I say go for it.</p>
            <h3>What's to come</h3>
            <p>Now for a bit of housekeeping. I have the barebones structure of the site completely covered at this point, but its management is still a bit clunky. For a blog post, I currently have to manually create and populate the HTML file that I share with the world. This is mildly annoying, and could easily be automated so that the only thing I have to do is type the post and commit the file to the repository. I anticipate the project will take a couple hours at most (fingers crossed), so I would like to get that done in the next few weeks. Another issue is that my site currently has very little mobile support, and given that <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing/mobile-marketing-analytics/mobile-marketing-statistics/">most people access the internet using their phone</a>, I should probably ensure that my site looks good on all devices. I don’t think it should be a big issue, but that’s just another thing to work on. Anyways, I’m sure this post was long-winded and not terribly exciting, so I’m gonna end it here. I fly to Sweden tomorrow, so I should probably be getting some rest anyways. In the coming days, I’ll be sure to post some photos!</p>
