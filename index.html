            <p>My name is Matt Johnson. I’m a freelance cybersecurity consultant and bug bounty hunter originally from Texas and currently based in Düsseldorf, Germany.

                <p>I am a cybersecurity consultant, auditor, penetration tester, bug bounty hunter, and a programming hobbyist. It's a long list, I know. I have a degree in Management Information Systems from Texas A&M University, which I attained with a 4.0 GPA in 3.5 years. In the time since, I have attained a Security+ certification as well as a Certification of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK) from the Cloud Security Alliance. I regularly attend workshops, do CTF challenges, and refine my programming and technical security capabilities through experimentation, trainings, and reading.</p>

                <p>Outside of work, I’m a person of many interests. One of those is music - I have been a guitarist for more than 12 years and love playing jazz, folk, rock, and country music. I love to cook, and try to cook new stuff all the time. I’m also an avid hiker and traveler. Lastly, as someone living in Germany, I am a student of the German language.</p>
