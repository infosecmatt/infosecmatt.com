            <h2>Howdy!</h2>
            <h3>My name is Matt Johnson. I'm a student at Texas A&amp;M pursuing an undergraduate's degree in management information systems. With a name like mine, I was destined for absolute internet anonymity, but I decided that sounded too good to be true. The next logical step was for me to make a website that consolidated my entire online presence into one convenient location.</h3>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="biocolumn">
                <p>Hey, I’m Matt. I’m a student at Texas A&amp;M University pursuing an undergraduate’s degree in management information systems. I have always liked economics and technology, so naturally I decided to pursue a degree that would let me have my cake and eat it too. In the future, I would like to use my technical knowledge and understanding of business processes to help create a more productive and connected world.</p>
                <p>Attending university has been a period of major growth for me. I have gone from an unmotivated (and somewhat reclusive) high school student to someone who has excelled in their coursework and beyond. I am always learning, whether it's in school or in my free time where you can find me reading about history, economics, and new developments in tech.</p>
                <p>Beyond technical knowledge, I have lots of experience speaking and working with people from around the world. My experience studying in Sweden for a semester and working at the Study Abroad Programs Office at A&amp;M allowed me to gain a more holistic and better appreciation for the world around me.  This has also helped me professionally, as it allowed me to better understand how business is conducted within different cultures and how I could use these ideas in my work.</p>

                <p>In my free time, I enjoy a range of activities. I have played guitar for seven years and love the creative outlet it gives me. Fitness is also very important to me. I like lifting weights, playing soccer, and generally staying active. I am a student of the Portuguese language and find the challenge of learning a language to be exciting and enriching. I have been learning since May 2018, and hope to pass the B2 exam (CEFR) by the end of 2019. As if learning one foreign language wasn't enough, I have also taken up German. In addition, I'm always open to new adventures, whether that means trying different foods, traveling to foreign places, or going out in nature.</p>
                <p>This summer, I'm interning at Weaver in the IT advisory division, where I will conduct IT audits to ensure the integrity and security of companies' financial information systems. If you have any advice for me or just want to chat, please email me at <a href="mailto:me@mattejohnson.com">me@mattejohnson.com</a>.</p>
