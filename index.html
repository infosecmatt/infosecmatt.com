            <h2>Howdy!</h2>
            <h3>My name is Matt Johnson. I'm a student at Texas A&amp;M pursuing an undergraduate's degree in management information systems. With a name like mine, I was destined for absolute internet anonymity, but I decided that sounded too good to be true. The next logical step was for me to make a website that consolidated my entire online presence into one convenient location.</h3>

            <h3>This is the product of that.</h3>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="biocolumn">
                <p>Howdy, I’m Matt. I'm a native Texan, a white-hat-hacker-hopeful (<em>Hey, cool it with the alliteration</em>), and a musician. I’m currently a student at Texas A&amp;M University pursuing an undergraduate’s degree in management information systems. I have always liked economics and technology, so naturally I decided to pursue a degree that would let me explore both.</p>
                <p>Over the course of my degree, I've grown and changed in many ways. I came in as a finance student. However, I've always been an IT nerd at heart. Sophomore year, I switched to MIS. Interestingly enough, my favorite class was not an MIS class (though some came close), but a world culture class. In that class, I learned just how cool the world can be. Because of that class, I applied to the A&amp;M Study Abroad Programs Office and sent in my application for a semester exchange program. I got the job and gained some experience and met some great people. I also got into my exchange program. I spent nearly 5 months in Jönköping, Sweden, where I had a truly unique and irreplaceable experience.</p>
                <p>Because of my experiences, I've spent lots of time speaking and working with people from around the world. In particular, my time in Sweden allowed me to gain a more holistic and better appreciation for the world around me. This has also helped me professionally, as it allowed me to better understand how business is conducted within different cultures and how I could use these ideas in my work.</p>

            <div class="biocolumn">
                <p>During the summer of 2019, I was an IT Advisory intern at Weaver. Over the course of my internship, I took part in an IT SOX audit of a multinational company, helped with the change management process for a Workday implementation, and gained a solid foundation in IT Governance. It was during this internship that I learned how much I liked information security. I have since been learning everything that I can about how to create, secure, and break into networks. I plan to pursue a master's degree in cybersecurity and conduct research into network vulnerabilities in order to create a more secure world.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy a range of activities. I have played guitar for eight years and love the creative outlet it gives me. Fitness is also very important to me. I briefly dabbled in powerlifting, and today focus on lifting (lighter) weights, running, and occasionally playing soccer. I am a Portuguese speaker with limited working proficiency, and I am always trying to improve my skills. I hope to pass the B2 exam (CEFR) by the end of 2020. As if learning one language wasn't enough, I have also taken up German. However, as the great Mark Twain once said, <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~gback/awfgrmlg.html">"...a gifted person ought to learn English (barring spelling and pronouncing) in thirty hours, French in thirty days, and German in thirty years."</a> Needless to say, it's a work in progress. In addition, I'm always open to new adventures, whether that be trying new foods, traveling to foreign places, or going out in nature.</p>
