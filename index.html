            <h3>My name is Matt Johnson. I'm a student at Texas A&M pursuing an undergraduate's degree in management information systems. With a name like mine, I was destined for absolute internet anonymity, but I decided that sounded too good to be true. The next logical step was for me to make a website that consolidated my entire online presence into one convenient location.</h3>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <div class="biocolumn">
                <p>Hey, I’m Matt. I’m a student at Texas A&M University pursuing an undergraduate’s degree in management information systems. I enjoy using technology to make life and business processes simpler. In the future, I would like to use my technical knowledge and understanding of business processes to help create a more connected world.</p>
                <p>Attending university has been a period of major growth for me. I have gone from an unmotivated (and somewhat reclusive) high school student to someone who has excelled in their coursework and beyond. I am always learning, whether it's in school or in my free time where you can find me reading about history, economics, and new developments in technology.</p>
                <p>Beyond technical knowledge, I have lots of experience speaking and working with people from around the world. Not only have I enjoyed this, but I believe that it has helped me develop a more holistic worldview. I’ve also learned a lot from seeing how other cultures go about living and conducting business, and believe that this knowledge aids me in decision-making.</p>

            <div class="biocolumn">
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy a range of activities. I have played guitar for seven years and love the creative outlet it gives me. Fitness is also very important to me. I like lifting weights, playing soccer, and generally staying active. I am a student of the Portuguese language and find the challenge of learning a language to be exciting and enriching. I have been learning since May 2018, and hope to pass the B2 exam (CEFR) by the end of 2019. Lastly, I love having new experiences, whether that is eating new food, meeting people with unique backgrounds, or traveling when I get the chance.</p>
                <p>I am currently looking for an IT or consulting internship for the summer of 2019. If you have any advice for me or just want to chat, please email me at <a href="mailto:me@mattejohnson.com">me@mattejohnson.com</a>.</p>
