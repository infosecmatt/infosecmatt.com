    <p>My name is Matt Johnson. I’m a freelance cybersecurity consultant originally from Texas and living in Düsseldorf, Germany. I specialize in security governance and technical security assessments and have worked with a wide variety of clients, including large public cloud providers, investment firms, banks, and public utility providers. I love doing CTF challenges, finding interesting development projects (or occasionally writing my own!), and keeping up with the latest security tools, frameworks, and research.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Outside of work, you'll find me hiking, playing guitar, cooking, and studying German.</p>
