        <h3>High-Level Information</h3>
        <p>Machine Name: Academy</p>
        <p>IP Address: 10.10.10.215</p>
        <p>Difficulty: Easy</p>
        <p>Summary: HackTheBox's Academy was a fun box that required an understanding of how to abuse web registration
            forms, move laterally on a Linux machine, parse logs for meaningful information, and abuse a dependency
            management executable to gain root access.</p>
        <p>Tools Used: Nmap, Gobuster, Burpsuite, linPEAS</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Initial Foothold</h3>
        <p>As always, I began by running Nmap:</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/00-academy-nmap.png" alt="" />
        <p>I spent a brief period of time trying to figure out whether port 33060 was the intended target, but I
            concluded it was likely a rabbit hole as I had difficulty finding any way to interact with the service. From
            there, I decided to enumerate the website:</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/02-academy-web-home.png" alt="" /> <img
            src="../img/posts/academy/03-academy-register.png" alt="" />
        <p>I made an account and explored the website:</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/04-academy-web-modules.png" alt="" />
        <p>Unfortunately, there was little in the way of useful information besides finding a potential username,
            <code>egre55</code>. Running Gobuster against the site yielded some additional webpages worth exploring,
            however.</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/01-academy-gobuster.png" alt="" />
        <p>Notably, <code>admin.php</code> stood out. In determining how I could gain access to admin credentials, I
            decided to revisit the user registration process. I inspected the interaction via Burpsuite and found
            something interesting:</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/05-academy-hacked-register-before.png" alt="" />
        <p>In the <code>POST</code> request associated with user creation, there's a third parameter in addition to the
            username and password. The parameter <code>roleid</code> was user-modifiable. I changed it from 0 to 1 and
            attempted to use the newly created account to log in as an administrator.</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/06-academy-hacked-register-after.png" alt="" /> <img
            src="../img/posts/academy/07-academy-admin-login.png" alt="" /> <img
            src="../img/posts/academy/08-academy-admin-home.png" alt="" />
        <p>Following the lead regarding the "issue" identified with <code>dev-staging01.academy.htb</code>, I visited
            the site:</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/09-academy-dev-staging.png" alt="" />
        <p>On the site, I found an API key for an application called Laravel.</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/10-academy-dev-staging-laravel-apikey.png" alt="" />
        <p>I was unable to find the software version anywhere, so I was running a bit blind for this part. I was able to
            identify that a specific version of Laravel from 2018 was susceptible to RCE (CVE-2018-15133) and had
            known-working exploits available. One of those exploits, <a
                href="https://github.com/aljavier/exploit_laravel_cve-2018-15133">a python-based script written by A.J.
                Javier</a>, had the capability for spawning an interactive shell. I attempted to use it, first running
            the default command <code>uname -a</code> to determine whether the vulnerability applied to this particular
            version of Laravel:</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/11-laravel-rce-poc.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Privilege Escalation</h3>
        <p>After confirming that I was able to get remote code execution, I spawned an interactive shell. The shell
            itself was very limited, so I used <code>/usr/bin/php</code> to upgrade to a more practical shell.</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/12-laravel-rce-fullshell.png" alt="" />
        <p>The <code>www-data</code> user had extremely limited capabilities and appeared to be sandboxed within the
            <code>/var/www/</code> directory, so my internal enumeration was limited to that general area. I eventually
            happened upon a file that contained database credentials. The database credentials did not work with MySQL
            in the end. After that failed, I performed a password spraying attack on all users with login capabilities.
            The password was successfully used against the <code>cry0l1t3</code> user.</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/13-internalenum-found-db-creds.png" alt="" /> <img
            src="../img/posts/academy/14-lateralmvmt-cry0l1t3.png" alt="" />
        <p>As shown above, the <code>cr0l1t3</code> user was a member of the <code>adm</code> group. On a typical Linux
            system, this group is responsible for system administration and, notably, monitoring. By running the
            <code>find</code> command, I was able to verify that fact and see which log files the group had read
            permission for.</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/15-find-adm-group-readfiles.png" alt="" />
        <p>Being able to parse Linux logs for useful information, whether that be for enumeration (on the offensive
            side) or forensics (on the IR side), is a bit of an art form. In production systems, you can't simply read
            them. There are thousands to millions of entries, most of which are benign. You need to know what kind of
            information is logged in each respective file, what specific information to look for, and whether identified
            information is useful vs. what is not. For those curious, here <a
                href="https://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/audit.html">[1]</a> <a
                href="https://www.eurovps.com/blog/important-linux-log-files-you-must-be-monitoring/">[2]</a> <a
                href="https://sematext.com/blog/auditd-logs-auditbeat-elasticsearch-logsene/">[3]</a> are some useful
            resources to get started learning about Linux log inspection. In my case, using the <code>aureport</code>
            tool I was able to find credentials for the <code>mrb3n</code> user.</p>
        <img src="../img/posts/academy/17-found-creds-mrb3n.png" alt="" />
        <p>The <code>mrb3n</code> user was able to run <code>composer</code> as root. Composer is a PHP dependency
            management tool, but has a fatal flaw: one can execute scripts via the program. <a
                href="https://gtfobins.github.io/">GTFObins</a> is an excellent website that identifies how to break out
            of restricted environments, escalate privileges, or successfully pivot on the machine using common tools
            found on Linux systems. For the Composer tool, there is an entry that specifies how to generate an
            interactive shell. Using this series of commands in combination with <code>sudo</code> privileges, one could
            escalate privileges to root.</p>
